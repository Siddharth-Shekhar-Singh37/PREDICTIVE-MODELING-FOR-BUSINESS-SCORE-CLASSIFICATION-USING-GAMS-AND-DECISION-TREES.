# PREDICTIVE-MODELING-FOR-BUSINESS-SCORE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-GAMS-AND-DECISION-TREES.
Developed predictive models to classify business scores and compared the performance of 
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Decision Trees. Performed data preprocessing by cleaning the dataset, handling 
missing values, normalizing numeric variables, and converting categorical data into factors. Applied Lasso Regression for 
feature selection, created new features, and transformed business scores into binary classifications (high/low). Built GAMs 
to capture non-linear relationships and Decision Trees for classification. The models were evaluated using accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, and adjusted R-squared. Decision Trees outperformed GAMs, demonstrating higher accuracy and 
sensitivity. Key tools and skills used include R (tidyverse, glmnet, gam, rpart), cross-validation, and model evaluation 
techniques.
